Follow the link above to access the app in action.

In this application I tried to create each element purely through Javascript. 

Everything in the checkers game first works as a logic element and through this logic the on screen representation is created.

Most rules existing in checkers exist in this game such as 'crowning', multiple leaps, forced takes etc.

I hope you enjoy testing out my game. It is intended as a two player game so grab a friend and try it out.
